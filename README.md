# Appointment_API
Test project

This is an Appointment API for an online university, which will have 2 roles: teacher and student.

Teacher:
- can indicate when and how much time it is available for individual lessons
- can indicate the price for a certain amount of time. For example, 15 minutes cost $ 30, 30 minutes = $ 55, 60 minutes = $ 100
- can confirm or reject student participation (approve / decline)

Student:
- can reserve a certain time
- can cancel the reservation
